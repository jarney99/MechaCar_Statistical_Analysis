Vehicle weight and AWD provided a non random amount of variance. 
Since P value is less than zero, the slope is not equal to zero. 
Since the R squared value is 71.49%, it will be correct more often than not, so it does predict prototypes effectively.

Total summary is looking at the statistics across all lots as a whole, while lot summary shows statistics individually. Lot 1 and 2 are very similar with a minor difference in mean, SD, and variance. However, lot 3 has lower mean and median, with a much higher level of variance and SD.

Lot 3 is the only lot with a P-value under 0.05 making it different than lot 1 and 2. Lot 3 also has the lowest T value which is -2.0196.
